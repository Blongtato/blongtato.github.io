        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in <br>
        my arms and set out walking once more. <under>I felt deeply <br>
        moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was <br>
        carrying a very fragile treasure.</under> <highl>It seemed to me, even, <br>
        that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</highl> In the <br>
        moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed <br>
        eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I <br>
        said to myself: <red>"What I see here is nothing but a <br>
        shell. What is most important is invisible . . ."</red><br>
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a <br>
        half-smile, I said to myself, again: <red>“What moves me <br>
        so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping <br>
        here, is his loyalty to a flower-the image of a rose <br>
        that shines through his whole being like the flame <br>
        of a lamp, even when he is asleep…”</red> And I felt <br>
        him to be more fragile still. <under>I felt the need of <br>
        protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that <br>
        might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…</under><br>
